  "description": "I don't like how it currently looks, where it shows all the labels and you toggle them on and off. Well, it's kind of neat, won't you understand? It's? but it's a little unusual. and at first when you look at it, at a card with no labels, labels, you might mistakenly think that all the labels are actually applied because they're barely ghosted. I think we just need to avoid showing them at all if they're not there but then we do also want to come up with a nice UX for adding labels.",
